Disaster_tweet_Sentiment_analysis

The objective of these notebooks is to create a classifier that differentiate between a tweet related to a real natural disaster and others that do not, using Natural language Processing (NLP) methods. Various metrics were used to evaluate the resulting models. The models were based on Logistic Regression, SVM, and Tensorflow Dense Network using gridSearchCV approach to optimize results.

The best resulting Deep Learning model is used to build a functioning Streamlit web-based App (Click [here](https://share.streamlit.io/osama-sidahmed/disaster_tweet_sentiment_analysis/main/Tweet_classifier.py)).
