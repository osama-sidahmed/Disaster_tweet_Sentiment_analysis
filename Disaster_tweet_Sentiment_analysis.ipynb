    "Off course before we create our features, we will have to normalize the text by Stemming and/or Lemmatizing the text to reduce the number of the to-be generated features as this Stemming and Lemmatization return words back to their original forms but they do that differently. In fact, Stemming and Lemmatization are two different techniques to reduce the features dimensionality. Stemming is more mechanical and crude - but usually faster - and can result in words that do not exist as stemmers remove the words affixes. Lemmatization algorithms are more effective as they reduce the dimensionality by reducing words back to their basic dictionary form. They also use the documents surrounding words to perform the Lemmatization operation.\n",
